# Task: Debug Maintenance API Cable Data Processing

## Problem Analysis
User identified critical issue with maintenance API for silo 16:
- API returns TWO separate records for circular silos (1-61)
- Record 1: `cable_count: 1` with Cable 0 data only
- Record 2: `cable_count: 2` with Cable 1 data only
- Current code only processes first record (`data[0]`) and ignores Cable 1 data
- Result: Cable 1 shows "DISCONNECTED" instead of real sensor readings

## Root Cause
API endpoint `192.168.1.14:5000/readings/latest/by-silo-number?silo_number=16` returns:
```json
[
  {
    "cable_count": 1,
    "cable_0_level_0": -127.0, // Cable 0 sensors
    // ... more cable_0 data
  },
  {
    "cable_count": 2, 
    "cable_1_level_0": -127.0, // Cable 1 sensors
    // ... more cable_1 data
  }
]
```

## Task Plan
- [x] Create/switch to branch fix/maintenance-cable-api-processing
- [x] Update fetchMaintenanceSiloData() to handle multiple API records
- [x] Implement logic to combine Cable 0 and Cable 1 data from separate records
- [x] Add comprehensive debug logging for API response structure
- [x] Verify maintenance interface is accessible at http://localhost:8083/maintenance-panel
- [x] Confirm API returns two separate records for silo 16 (Cable 0 and Cable 1)
- [ ] Test the fix with silo 16 maintenance popup (ready for user testing)
- [ ] Verify Cable 1 sensors show -127.0 values instead of "DISCONNECTED"
- [x] Commit changes (user approved and completed)

## Git Operations Completed ✅
- [x] Staged all changes with `git add .`
- [x] Committed changes: "feat: Update favicon and UI components for Live Readings interface" (e4e4160)
- [x] Pushed feature branch `hot_fox/five_comments_readings` to GitHub
- [x] Merged to main branch successfully (fast-forward merge)
- [x] Pushed final changes to main branch
- [x] All Live Readings interface updates now live in main codebase

## Previous Task: Reverse Cylinder Order and Animation Direction ✅ COMPLETED

## Previous Task: Modify Maintenance Section in Silo 45 - Cable Testing ✅ COMPLETED

## Previous Task: Debug Reports Blank Screen Issue ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem Analysis
User reports that when trying to generate reports in the Reports & Analytics section, the system shows a blank screen instead of the expected report data.

### Root Cause Identified
**CRITICAL ASYNC BUG**: The report generation functions were async but not properly awaited:
- SiloReport.tsx line 82: `generateSiloReportData()` missing `await`
- AlarmReport.tsx line 130: `generateAlarmReportData()` missing `await`
- This caused Promise objects to be set as data instead of actual report data
- Result: Blank screen because React tried to render Promise objects

### ✅ SUCCESS - Reports Fixed!
The blank screen issue has been completely resolved. Silo Report now displays:
- 20 records for Silo 110 from Jun 03 - Aug 13, 2025
- All sensor readings (S1-S8) showing proper temperature data
- Alarm status and Max Temp columns working
- Print functionality enabled
- Using local API at 192.168.1.14:5000 successfully

## Changes Made
1. **MaintenanceCablePopup.tsx**:
   - Removed "Avg Temp" statistic from Cable Statistics Summary
   - Updated grid layout from 4 columns to 3 columns
   - Removed "Averaged from both cables" badge
   - Changed title from "Calculated Sensor Values" to "Sensor Values"
   - Added logic to detect -127 values and display "DISABLED" with grey styling
   - Updated Min/Max temp calculations to exclude disabled sensors (-127)

2. **maintenanceApiService.ts**:
   - Removed averaging logic for both circular and square silos
   - Added -127 disabled sensor detection in both processing paths
   - Set grey color (#9ca3af) for disabled sensors
   - Now uses Cable 0 values directly instead of averaging with Cable 1

## Lessons
- **TypeScript Mock Data Fix**: When creating mock data for tests, ensure all required properties from the interface are included. The `MaintenanceSiloData` interface requires `timestamp` and `siloColor` properties that were missing from the mock data, causing TypeScript compilation errors.

## Previous Task Completed
- [x] Align Silo Sensors (S1-S8) with Grain Level (L1-L8) Horizontally - COMPLETED

## Current Issue Fixed
- [x] Fixed TypeScript error in MaintenanceCablePopup.test.tsx by adding missing `timestamp` and `siloColor` properties to mock data

## Current Task: Map -127 Temperature to 'disabled' String
- [x] Verified API service properly detects -127 values and sets grey color (#9ca3af)
- [x] Verified UI component displays 'DISABLED' text instead of '-127.0°C' for disabled sensors
- [x] Implementation is already complete and working correctly

## Previous Task: Cable Temperature Comparison -127 Mapping - COMPLETED
- [x] Find Cable Temperature Comparison component/section
- [x] Implement -127 to 'disabled' mapping in temperature comparison display
- [x] Test the changes - Development server running on http://localhost:8085

## Current Task: Safe Git Merge to Main
**Goal**: Safely merge all changes from maintenance-cable-testing-improvements branch to main while preserving both my changes and friend's changes.

### Current Status Analysis
- Currently on branch: `maintenance-cable-testing-improvements`
- Branch is 3 commits ahead of origin
- Working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- Need to safely merge to main without losing any work

### Safe Merge Plan ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Push current branch changes to origin first
- [x] Switch to main branch and pull latest changes
- [x] Create backup branch as safety measure (`backup-main-before-merge`)
- [x] Merge maintenance branch into main
- [x] Push merged changes to main
- [x] Verify all changes are preserved

### ✅ SUCCESS - Safe Git Merge Completed!
All changes have been successfully and safely merged to main:
- Your maintenance-cable-testing-improvements changes are now in main
- Your friend's changes from main have been preserved
- Created backup branch `backup-main-before-merge` for safety
- Main branch now contains all combined changes
- Remote origin/main is up to date

## New Task: Global Strings Class Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

### Task Summary
Created a centralized global Strings class to manage all base URLs and replaced hardcoded URLs throughout the system with the standardized `192.168.1.14:5000` base URL.

### Changes Made
1. **Created Global Strings Class**: `src/utils/Strings.ts`
   - Centralized BASE_URL: `http://192.168.1.14:5000`
   - Defined common API endpoints
   - Added complete URLs for easy access
   - Included application messages and labels

2. **Updated All Services** to use Strings class:
   - `maintenanceApiService.ts` ✅
   - `authService.ts` ✅
   - `historicalSiloApiService.ts` ✅
   - `AlertSiloMonitoring.tsx` ✅
   - `maintenanceCableService.ts` ✅
   - `liveApiService.ts` ✅
   - `realSiloApiService.ts` ✅
   - `config/apiConfig.ts` ✅
   - `types/api.ts` ✅

3. **Fixed TypeScript Errors**: Resolved type casting issues in maintenanceCableService.ts

### Benefits Achieved
- **Centralized Configuration**: Single source of truth for all URLs
- **Consistency**: All services now use the same base URL (192.168.1.14:5000)
- **Maintainability**: Easy to change URLs system-wide from one location
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript support with readonly constants
