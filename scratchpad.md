# Task: Modify Maintenance Section in Silo 45 - Cable Testing

## Problem Analysis
Need to modify the Maintenance section in Silo 45 - Cable Testing to:
1. Remove average readings
2. Handle disabled sensors (value -127) by coloring them grey

## Task Plan
- [x] Create new branch for changes
- [x] Find the Maintenance section in Silo 45 - Cable Testing
- [x] Identify where average readings are displayed and remove them
- [x] Add logic to detect -127 values (disabled sensors)
- [x] Apply grey styling for disabled sensors
- [x] Remove remaining averaging logic from API service
- [x] Test the changes
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Commit changes (requires user approval) ✅ COMPLETED

## Previous Task: Debug Reports Blank Screen Issue ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem Analysis
User reports that when trying to generate reports in the Reports & Analytics section, the system shows a blank screen instead of the expected report data.

### Root Cause Identified
**CRITICAL ASYNC BUG**: The report generation functions were async but not properly awaited:
- SiloReport.tsx line 82: `generateSiloReportData()` missing `await`
- AlarmReport.tsx line 130: `generateAlarmReportData()` missing `await`
- This caused Promise objects to be set as data instead of actual report data
- Result: Blank screen because React tried to render Promise objects

### ✅ SUCCESS - Reports Fixed!
The blank screen issue has been completely resolved. Silo Report now displays:
- 20 records for Silo 110 from Jun 03 - Aug 13, 2025
- All sensor readings (S1-S8) showing proper temperature data
- Alarm status and Max Temp columns working
- Print functionality enabled
- Using local API at 192.168.1.14:5000 successfully

## Changes Made
1. **MaintenanceCablePopup.tsx**:
   - Removed "Avg Temp" statistic from Cable Statistics Summary
   - Updated grid layout from 4 columns to 3 columns
   - Removed "Averaged from both cables" badge
   - Changed title from "Calculated Sensor Values" to "Sensor Values"
   - Added logic to detect -127 values and display "DISABLED" with grey styling
   - Updated Min/Max temp calculations to exclude disabled sensors (-127)

2. **maintenanceApiService.ts**:
   - Removed averaging logic for both circular and square silos
   - Added -127 disabled sensor detection in both processing paths
   - Set grey color (#9ca3af) for disabled sensors
   - Now uses Cable 0 values directly instead of averaging with Cable 1

## Lessons
- **TypeScript Mock Data Fix**: When creating mock data for tests, ensure all required properties from the interface are included. The `MaintenanceSiloData` interface requires `timestamp` and `siloColor` properties that were missing from the mock data, causing TypeScript compilation errors.

## Previous Task Completed
- [x] Align Silo Sensors (S1-S8) with Grain Level (L1-L8) Horizontally - COMPLETED

## Current Issue Fixed
- [x] Fixed TypeScript error in MaintenanceCablePopup.test.tsx by adding missing `timestamp` and `siloColor` properties to mock data

## Current Task: Map -127 Temperature to 'disabled' String
- [x] Verified API service properly detects -127 values and sets grey color (#9ca3af)
- [x] Verified UI component displays 'DISABLED' text instead of '-127.0°C' for disabled sensors
- [x] Implementation is already complete and working correctly

## Previous Task: Cable Temperature Comparison -127 Mapping - COMPLETED
- [x] Find Cable Temperature Comparison component/section
- [x] Implement -127 to 'disabled' mapping in temperature comparison display
- [x] Test the changes - Development server running on http://localhost:8085

## Current Task: Safe Git Merge to Main
**Goal**: Safely merge all changes from maintenance-cable-testing-improvements branch to main while preserving both my changes and friend's changes.

### Current Status Analysis
- Currently on branch: `maintenance-cable-testing-improvements`
- Branch is 3 commits ahead of origin
- Working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- Need to safely merge to main without losing any work

### Safe Merge Plan
- [ ] Push current branch changes to origin first
- [ ] Switch to main branch and pull latest changes
- [ ] Create backup branch as safety measure
- [ ] Merge maintenance branch into main
- [ ] Push merged changes to main
- [ ] Verify all changes are preserved
