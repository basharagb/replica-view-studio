# Task: Debug Reports Blank Screen Issue

## Problem Analysis
User reports that when trying to generate reports in the Reports & Analytics section, the system shows a blank screen instead of the expected report data. From screenshots provided:
1. Temperature Graphs tab works fine
2. Silo Report tab shows configuration form but generates blank screen
3. Console shows many API calls being made successfully
4. Need to identify root cause of blank screen issue

## Current State
- ReportSystem.tsx: Main component with 3 tabs (Temperature Graphs, Silo Report, Alarm Report)
- SiloReport.tsx: Shows configuration form with progressive enabling
- reportService.ts: Handles data generation with API integration and fallback
- Console shows successful API calls to idealchiprnd.pythonanywhere.com
- Dev server running on http://localhost:8080

## Debugging Plan
- [x] Examine current reports structure and components
- [x] Check console logs for errors during report generation
- [x] Analyze reportService.ts data generation logic
- [x] Check if generateSiloReportData function is async but not awaited
- [x] Verify SiloReport component handles async data properly
- [x] FOUND CRITICAL BUG: Both generateSiloReportData and generateAlarmReportData are async but not awaited
- [x] Fixed SiloReport.tsx: Added await to generateSiloReportData call
- [x] Fixed AlarmReport.tsx: Added await to generateAlarmReportData call
- [x] Updated API endpoint from idealchiprnd.pythonanywhere.com to 192.168.1.14:5000
- [x] Test report generation with different silo selections
- [x] Verify blank screen issue is resolved ✅ WORKING PERFECTLY!
- [ ] Commit changes and create new branch

## ✅ SUCCESS - Reports Fixed!
The blank screen issue has been completely resolved. Silo Report now displays:
- 20 records for Silo 110 from Jun 03 - Aug 13, 2025
- All sensor readings (S1-S8) showing proper temperature data
- Alarm status and Max Temp columns working
- Print functionality enabled
- Using local API at 192.168.1.14:5000 successfully

## Root Cause Identified
**CRITICAL ASYNC BUG**: The report generation functions were async but not properly awaited:
- SiloReport.tsx line 82: `generateSiloReportData()` missing `await`
- AlarmReport.tsx line 130: `generateAlarmReportData()` missing `await`
- This caused Promise objects to be set as data instead of actual report data
- Result: Blank screen because React tried to render Promise objects

## Notes
- Both components use flex-col with gap spacing
- LabCylinder uses h-6 for sensor items
- GrainLevelCylinder uses heightStyle with 20px height
- Need to ensure consistent heights and spacing for perfect alignment
